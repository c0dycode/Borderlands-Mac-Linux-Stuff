# Info
On Linux the filesizes are about:

BL2 (36.4MB)

TPS (35.8MB)

and should be located somewhere here:

~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/

For Mac:
BL2 (66.7MB)
TPS (60.5MB)

You'll most likely have moved a Patchfile into the "Binaries"-folder before, if you're here.
From there, you go up two folders. You should now see a folder called "MacOS". 
You be at something like:

Borderlands2.app\Contents\MacOS

Inside of that, there should be the file that you need to edit!

Address is the address in the file you have to patch. Every Hexeditor should have a "goto"-feature these days.
